# bashcord

***please help me***

## Setup

Run:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/trvv/bashcord
$ cd bashcord
# make install
```
and then you can
```
$ bashcord
```
to start the bashcord shell.

## Usage

### As a CLI tool

Just run bashcord man... idk...

### As a library

Once installed, add
```Bash
source /bin/bashcord
# ...
connect
```
which will provide the internal bashcord tools to your script, and adding
event handlers and variable configuration can be done before calling
`connect`.
